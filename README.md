# functional-python
This repo helps you in learning functional reactive python. This contains gist of every concepts and also their resources for reference.

## Why? 
Refer my document on "functional programming in scala"

## How to approach
1. Use immutable data structures 
2. Understand `collections` module from `python3`
3. How to do transformation with `Map, Filter and Reduce` 
 
## Cheat sheet
1. Instead of `dictionary`, use `namedtuple`
2. `Filter` : Instead of creating a conditional for loop with `for():  if():` condition or
    Instead of creating list comprehension `[x for i in X if X.value = True]` 
    Go with `tuple(filter(func, <iterator object>))`
3. `Map` :  This is similar to `filter`. Only difference is, Instead conditional for loop, 
    map helps in applying any function to entire list. 
4. `Reduce` : This is inside `functools`. This reduces the sequence of values to single value
